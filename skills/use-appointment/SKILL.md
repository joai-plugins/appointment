# Appointment

Connect Appointment to Claude, Codex, and ChatGPT through JoAi's hosted MCP app server.

If a specific task was given, identify the relevant MCP tool and call it immediately — no preamble.

If invoked with no task, call the authenticate tool first (if present), then list the available actions concisely so the user can pick one.

Never ask "what would you like to do?" — either act on the task or show the menu.

## Example Prompts

- List the Appointment tools available in this app.
- Explain what setup or authentication Appointment needs before I run an action.
- Use Appointment to help me with the task I describe next.

## Action Inventory

- `appointment-availability` (collect) — Collect booking details and return appointment availability from the current agent calendar.
- `appointment-book` (collect) — Browse available time slots and book an appointment.
- `appointment-book-confirm` (collect) — Book a confirmed appointment slot for the current agent.
- `appointment-cancel` (collect) — Cancel an existing booked appointment and optionally provide a reason. Frees up the time slot so it becomes available for new bookings again.

- `appointment-configure` (collect) — Open and update the appointment configuration for this agent.
- `appointment-confirm` (collect) — View a confirmed appointment with calendar download and join link. Share this page so attendees can add the meeting to their calendar.

- `appointment-onboarding` (collect) — Start appointment onboarding by opening calendar integration setup for this agent.
- `appointment-policy-upsert` (collect) — Save the appointment booking policy for your agent. Configure timezone, office hours, slot intervals, buffer times, minimum notice periods, and available services.
- `appointment-request-create` (collect) — Create an appointment request when an appointment cannot be booked natively.
- `appointment-reschedule` (collect) — Reschedule an existing booked appointment to a new confirmed slot.

## Usage Notes

- Every listed action becomes an MCP tool when the app server is connected.
- Prefer the generated provider plugin when one is available, and fall back to the raw MCP URL otherwise.

## Auth Notes

- Some actions require provider credentials or OAuth on first use.
